To evaluate any mn, they are represented as dots starting from m0 and building the triangle. Each horizontal row represents fixed an, which the bn forwards one step as one climbs up to one step top. Then, discrete paths are to be tracked (by multiplying each step’s contribution) and summed up that leads from m0 from mn. For example, this picture evaluates the moment m4. We start from m0, track all discrete paths that lead to m4, and sum up all the paths. Here, the red arrow shows one such path, which evaluates"

            "(operators) and measure- ments. A quantum gate is a unitary matrix that applies to the state vector of the qubits. For example, the 𝑋gate is a single-qubit gate. Applying the 𝑋gate to a single-qubit state 𝛼|0⟩+ 𝛽|1⟩follows matrix multiplication: 𝑋= \u00100 1 1 0 \u0011 ⇒𝑋 \u0010𝛼 𝛽 \u0011 = \u00100 1 1 0 \u0011 \u0010𝛼 𝛽 \u0011 = \u0010𝛽 𝛼 \u0011 Thus, gate 𝑋transforms the state 𝛼|0⟩+ 𝛽|1⟩to 𝛽|0⟩+ 𝛼|1⟩. A Quantum gate applied on 𝑁qubits can always be represented by a 2𝑁× 2𝑁complex unitary matrix. For example, the two-qubit 𝐶𝑁𝑂𝑇 gate has the following matrix representation: 𝐶𝑁𝑂𝑇= ©­­ « 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 ª®® ¬ 𝑅𝑧(𝜃) 𝐻 𝑌 𝑞1 𝑞2 𝑞3 Fig. 2. Quantum circuit example In this paper, the quantum programs are represented in the quantum circuit diagram. Fig. 2 shows an example of a 3-qubit circuit. In the quantum circuit, each horizontal line represents a qubit. Fig 2 has three qubits: 𝑞1, 𝑞2, and 𝑞3. The square blocks and ⊕symbols on the horizontal lines represent gates applied on the qubits associated with the horizontal lines. Fig 2 has three single-qubit gates: one 𝑌gate on 𝑞1, one 𝐻gate on 𝑞3, and a 𝑅𝑧gate on 𝑞3. Besides, a 𝐶𝑁𝑂𝑇gate is applied on (𝑞2,𝑞3) between the 𝐻gate and the 𝑅𝑧 gate. 2.3 Quantum Simulation Quantum Hamiltonia"

Decomposition of exp(i𝑋4𝑌3𝑍2𝐼1 𝜃 2 ) From Pauli Strings to Circuit: A critical property of a Pauli string 𝑃is that for any 𝜃∈R the operator exp(i𝑃𝜃 2 ) can be decomposed into basic gates easily. We introduce the decomposition process using an example shown in Fig. 3, which illustrates the synthesis of exp(i𝑋4𝑌3𝑍2𝐼1 𝜃 2 ). First, two identical layers of single-qubit gates are added at the beginning and the end of the circuit snippet. In these two layers, the H or Y gates are applied on the qubits whose corresponding operators in the Pauli string are X (i.e., 𝑞4) or Y (i.e., 𝑞3), respectively."
